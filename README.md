# Project Pizza - Hungry Hugo's Pizzeria

The assignment was to create a interactive pizza-place using javaScript operators prompt() and alert().

## The problem

I started out by creating different let variables, but later changed some to const when I began to understand how to use them differently. I completed the script.js by using the operators prompt() and alert () and conditional statements (if, else if). I tried to change the background-image in css, but I didn't put much time into that after I understood that the alert() is too dominant and makes the pic load after the alerts even if I put the javaScript-files in the bottom of my body-tag.

I then tackled the stretch-goals with the switch approach. I found this to be very difficult even though I tried to write the code in text and flow charts with pen and paper. The things I found the most difficult was understanding the logic in when to use what variables in switch and how they correlated in the different cases. I finally understood with help from my team and google.

If I had more time I would try to figure out how to validate the information from the prompts, ie: make sure they enter the correct values.
